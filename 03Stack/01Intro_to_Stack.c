/*
    1. It is a linear data structure.
    2. In array random access is possible, in linked list sequential access is possible, in stack limited access is possible.

    It is a ordered list or collection or container which is going to follow a rule for insertion and deletion of a data.
    And that rule or restriction is, that insertion and deletion is only possible from one end. eg - stack of CDs.
    The rule on which stack works is LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out).

                                    OPERATIONS ON STACK
    Some fundamental operations on stack -
    1. Push - inserting an element.
    2. Pop - taking out or deleting the topmost element from the stack. No need to pass any arguement to pop function.
    3. Peek or Top - it will return the topmost element from the stack without removing/deleting it.
    3. isEmpty - will return true if stack is empty otherwise return false. 
    4. isFull - will return true if stack is full otherwise return false. 

    There can be many other operations like travesing the stack, finding min. or max. element from the stack etc.

    Two ways to implement stack -
    1. Static implementation - using arrays.
    2. Dynamic implementation - using linked list.

    Application - 
    1. in reversing a string
    2. undo mechanism in text editors
    3. in recursion/function call 
    4. in checking parenthesis balance (compiler checking for opening and closing brackets)  
    5. infix to postfix/prefix conversion
    6. in topological sorting 
    7. in DFS (Depth First Search)    
    8. in tower of Hanoi problem
    9. in tree traversal
    10. evaluation of postfix expression etc.
