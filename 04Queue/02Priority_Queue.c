/*                                      PRIORITY QUEUE

    Priority Queue is an abstract data type that is similar to a queue, and every element has some priority value associated with it. 
    The priority of the elements in a priority queue determines the order in which elements are served (i.e., the order in which they are removed).
    If in any case the elements have same priority, they are served as per their ordering in the queue.

    Therefore all the elements are either arranged in an ascending or descending order.

    PROPERTIES OF PRIORITY QUEUE

    So, a priority Queue is an extension of the queue with the following properties. 

    - Every item has a priority associated with it.
    - An element with high priority is dequeued before an element with low priority.
    - If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.


    PRIORITY QUEUE APPLICATIONS

    Some of the applications of a priority queue are:

    - Dijkstra's algorithm
    - for implementing stack
    - for load balancing and interrupt handling in an operating system
    - for data compression in Huffman code
