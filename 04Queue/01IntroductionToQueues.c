//It is an ordered list which follows the principle of FIFO(First in first out) or LILO(Last in last out)
//insertion = from rear/tail, technical name = enqueue
//deletion = from head/front, technical name = dequeue
// It has two ends front and rear while stack has only one end
//Operations : enqueue, dequeue, peek, isFull, isEmpty. All have time complexity = O(n).

//Application : it is used where we want to serve the request on a single shared resource  
//For Example : printer, processes in operating system.
