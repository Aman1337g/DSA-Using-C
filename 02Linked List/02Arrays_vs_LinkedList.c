//Array vs Linked List

/*
1. Cost of accessing an element - in array random access is possible time complexity = O(1), in linked list only sequential access is possible time complexity = O(n)

2. Memory requirement + Memory utilization - memory requirement in array is less than linked list and memory utilization is more efficient in linked list than array.

3. Cost of insertion - 
 a) insert at beginning = in array we have to shift the elements to right so O(n) , in linked list we just need to add a node at beginning so O(1)
 a) insert at end = in array O(1) as random access is possible , in linked list O(n) as we have to tranverse the linked list to the last and then add the node
 a) insert at ith position = in array O(n) , in linked list O(n)

4. Easy to use - Array is easy to use than linked list.

5. Searching Operations - in array both linear and binary search are possible but in linked list only linear search is possible.
